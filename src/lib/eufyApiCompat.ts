/**
 * Compatibility shims for the Eufy Mega/v6 backend.
 *
 * Development of eufy-security-client has ended (bropat/eufy-security-client#965), so defects that
 * only show up against the migrated v6 backend have to be corrected here. Every shim in this file
 * patches a prototype before EufySecurity.initialize() runs and documents the condition under which
 * it can be deleted again.
 *
 * 1. Success code (see below): the v6 backend answers 200 where the library expects 0.
 * 2. Legacy push check: a migrated account is rejected by the legacy push endpoint forever, but the
 *    rejection is logged as an error on every push reconnect - see applyEufyApiCompatibility().
 * 3. Stale v6 identity: a rejected identity is evicted but the failed call is not retried - same.
 * 4. Unknown device types: devices the library does not know get no states - same.
 *
 * ## 1. Success code
 *
 * Eufy started answering with the HTTP style code 200 in the JSON body of endpoints that used to
 * return the legacy application code 0. eufy-security-client accepts only 0
 * (`ResponseErrorCode.CODE_OK`) and therefore reports perfectly valid answers as failures:
 *
 *     [http] [HTTPApi.getPassportProfile] Get passport profile - Response code not ok
 *     [{"code":200,"msg":"","data":{...}}]
 *
 * The login never completes after that, and the house, station and device lists stay empty.
 *
 * Upstream carries the fix in bropat/eufy-security-client#975, but development of that library has
 * ended (bropat/eufy-security-client#965), so it will most likely never be released. 21 of the 22
 * affected comparisons read `response.data` of the public `HTTPApi.request()`, so normalizing the
 * code in that single funnel repairs all of them at once.
 *
 * The 22nd is the static `HTTPApi.getApiBaseFromCloud()`, which calls got directly and talks to a
 * different host (extend.eufylife.com). It is deliberately left untouched: a failure there aborts
 * the login with an ApiBaseLoadError long before a profile is ever requested, which is not the
 * behaviour reported in the field.
 *
 * Remove this shim once the adapter depends on a library version that accepts both codes.
 *
 * ## 2. Legacy push check
 *
 * `EufySecurity` registers the FCM token on the legacy and on the v6 backend independently and
 * treats push as established if EITHER accepted it. Its own comment states that "a migrated account
 * is rejected by the legacy endpoint", yet `HTTPApi.checkPushToken()` logs that expected rejection
 * at error level:
 *
 *     [http] [HTTPApi.checkPushToken] Check push token - Response code not ok
 *     [{"code":10003,"msg":"Anfrage fehlgeschlagen.",...}]
 *
 * For a migrated account the check can never succeed, but it runs again on every push reconnect,
 * which is what iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.eusec#173 reports. The results are not used
 * anywhere either: the library assigns them to `pushCloudRegistered`/`pushCloudChecked` and never
 * reads those again. So the first rejection is remembered and the endpoint is not asked a second
 * time - that keeps the single honest error of a genuinely broken legacy registration while
 * dropping the repetition, and saves two HTTP round trips per reconnect.
 *
 * Remove this shim once the library stops asking the legacy endpoint for migrated accounts.
 *
 * ## 3. Stale v6 identity
 *
 * The v6 session persists the per-cluster ECDH identities, so after a restart the first signed call
 * can be made with an identity the backend has already dropped. `MegaHTTPApi.signedPost()` detects
 * that (`CODE_NEED_NEGOTIATE_KEY`), evicts the cached identities - and then returns the failure to
 * the caller instead of repeating the call, so the re-handshake it just triggered is wasted:
 *
 *     [http] [MegaHTTPApi.signedPost] MegaApi identity rejected - evicting cached identities [{"code":4404}]
 *     [main] [MegaTransition.registerMegaPushToken] v6 push: register_push_token returned a non-zero code
 *     [main] Push notification connection closed
 *
 * On every adapter start push therefore reports itself closed first and only establishes ~10s later,
 * on the next attempt. `MegaHTTPApi.call()` is the single funnel every signed v6 request goes
 * through, so retrying there once - after the eviction, with a freshly negotiated identity - covers
 * push registration and every other v6 call.
 *
 * Remove this shim once the library retries an evicted identity itself.
 *
 * ## 4. Unknown device types
 *
 * The library creates an `UnknownDevice` without any states for device types it does not know. The
 * eufyCam C31 (T817L, type 10031, iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.eusec#156) is one of them.
 * Its owner reports that livestream, motion and person detection, light and alarm work once the type
 * is replaced by 60 (`SOLO_CAMERA_SPOTLIGHT_1080`). The device and the station list are the only
 * places the type comes from, so both are rewritten right after they are fetched. The raw params of
 * such a device are logged once, since the library no longer logs it as unknown.
 *
 * Known limit: type 60 has no pan/tilt command and carries battery states the wired C31 lacks. A
 * type of its own needs a C31 on the bench.
